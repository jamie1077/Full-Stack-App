# Full-Stack-App

This project provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating, and deleting courses in the database.

## Running the project
Open 2 terminals, navigate to the client and api folders, run **npm install** and then run **npm start** in both terminals.
